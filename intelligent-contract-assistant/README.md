ðŸ§  Developer Task: "Intelligent Contract Assistant" using LangChain and Python
ðŸ“‹ Objective:
Build a contract assistant tool that takes in a PDF contract (e.g. an NDA or service agreement), extracts key clauses, and answers user questions about the contract using LangChain and an LLM (OpenAI or similar).

ðŸ§± Requirements:
Document Ingestion

Accept a PDF upload via CLI or basic web interface.

âœ… Use PyPDF2 or pdfplumber to extract text.

âœ… Chunk the document into manageable pieces using LangChain's TextSplitter.

Vector Store Setup

âœ… Use FAISS or Chroma to create an embedding store from the chunks.

âœ… Use OpenAIEmbeddings or similar (can be mocked if API is not available).

QA Interface

Implement a basic interface (CLI or Streamlit app) where the user can:

Ask questions like "What is the termination clause?" or "Who owns the IP?"

Get responses grounded in the uploaded document using RetrievalQA.

Bonus (for higher difficulty)

Add a named entity recognition (NER) step to extract key fields like parties, dates, and monetary values.

Implement a feedback mechanism so the assistant can improve answers over multiple interactions.

Show source text excerpts alongside answers.

ðŸŽ¯ Deliverables:
Python code (ideally in a GitHub repo).

README.md with setup instructions.

Sample contract PDF and example queries.

Optional: a Streamlit or Flask app demoing the functionality.
